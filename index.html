  After a few months of working with this group in creating a brand & as well as an effective advertisement for our baked cookies, I can tell that it was pleasant despite having a few difficulties such as misunderstanding and a lack of time management. We have struggled to find time due to the tight deadlines and the participants' complicated personal agendas. Unfortunately, we also encountered a number of technical difficulties during the recording, as well as strong background noises, causing our voice to be less distinct in the video. Because the allocated member is knowledgeable in that field, editing was not a major issue on our part. Even though we went through a lot, we still finished it because of each other's cooperation.
